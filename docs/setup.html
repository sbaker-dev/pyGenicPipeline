    <h1>Setup</h1>

    <p>
        This is going to assume your working on a linux server. We will be using a python environment setup via conda.
        If you have never worked with conda before, then follow these instructions line by line. Otherwise, you just
        need to install pyGenicPipeline and override the bgen-reader with a forked version by sbaker-dev; needed to
        allow for custom file paths of index files

# What this directory Contains

This directory contains blank yaml config documents that you can edit to submit as well as some shell scripts. All the 
shell submission scripts use. If you copy these across to your linux environment you need to run both chmod to allow it
run if it is a .sh file but also dos2unix on all files. 

```shell script
chmod +x ScriptName.sh
dos2unix ExampleFile.yaml
```

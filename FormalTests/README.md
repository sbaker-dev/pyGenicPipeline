### UnitTesting

This testing set uses files from the example of [this tutorial][exd]. These files are to large to commit to github at
around 85mb so you will need to manually download them, and the place them into the Data folder. **Do not rename the 
files.** For set of unit root tests to work you **must** have plink 1.9 installed, and you must set this path in the
config.yaml for your system/environment.

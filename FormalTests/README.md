### UnitTesting

This...well it more or less violates the principles of unit Testing, but its as close as this process has. Methods, 
processes, and other parts of the program are test here, with arguments read in via yaml files just like the program it
self would be most of the time. 

Tests require data from [this example set][exd] (download at the end of the first paragraph). If you want to test these
you will need to change the config files via each .yaml or generate them yourself via pyGeneticPipe\support\ArgMaker
